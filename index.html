        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, and welcome to my personal website! My name is Son Tran, and I'm a data science enthusiast with a strong interest in data visualization and applying analytical insights to real-world scenarios. As data becomes an increasingly essential part of understanding patterns and predicting trends, I find myself captivated by the potential it holds to solve complex problems and uncover hidden insights.</p>

        <p>Data visualization, in particular, is one of my favorite aspects of data science. It transforms raw numbers into a visual story, making complex information accessible and meaningful. I’m fascinated by how a well-designed visualization can reveal trends that might otherwise go unnoticed. In my studies and projects, I aim to hone my skills in data visualization to explore various topics, especially in fields I'm passionate about.</p>

        <p>Outside of academics, I’m deeply interested in sports, e-sports, and fitness. Whether it’s tracking performance in soccer, analyzing strategies in competitive gaming, or monitoring workout progress, I see endless possibilities to apply data science to my hobbies. I hope this website serves as a platform to showcase my journey, projects, and how I’m integrating data science with my personal interests. Thanks for visiting, and I look forward to sharing my work with you!</p>
