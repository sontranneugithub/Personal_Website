        <h2>Applying Data Science to My Interests</h2>
    </header>

    <section>
        <p>Combining my love for sports and data science allows me to track progress, analyze strategies, and explore performance metrics. By applying data science to these areas, I gain new insights into both my hobbies and potential future applications in the sports and fitness industry.</p>

        <p>In soccer, I am particularly interested in tracking performance data to assess skill improvement over time. For e-sports, I focus on analyzing in-game strategies to identify patterns that enhance gameplay. Finally, in fitness, I use data visualization to monitor my workout progress and set achievable goals based on previous performance.</p>
